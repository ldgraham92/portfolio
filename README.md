# Lindsey Graham -  Milestone Project 1 - Front End Resume with Contact Form


# Introduction
- TECHCareers measures your progress with a series of assignments, quizzes and milestone projects. Milestone projects are larger projects that are expected to be completed to a professional standard of quality. Typically this means spending much more time on polishing a project after it is ‘finished’. Most other assignments will be satisfied by you making your app work, but this milestone project is meant to be a professional portfolio piece and you can expect this kind of project to be carefully inspected by employers who are looking through your Github account. Pay close attention to the Rubric for this assignment. You will notice that we are inspecting this project for things like spelling, and accessibility. We will be running each of your source files through validator(s). The list of requirements in the rubric is much longer than in previous assignments but you should notice that most of the items on the rubric focus on quality assurance rather than focusing on adding more features to this project.


- It is our strong suggestion that you plan on finishing your project at least a day and a half early so that you can double-check the rubric and make sure that your code is perfect. You will likely need to double-check because by the time you reach the end of the list you may have broken something from earlier in the list, so make sure that the full project is fully validated and tested before the deadline. 

- Time must be tracked.

- As a milestone project, you will be expected to present the finished product to the class.

# Challenges
Challenge goals are optional and are meant for students who would like a more difficult challenge. You are permitted to add any feature you like so long as you have the mandatory requirements completed.  
- You can add buttons to show/hide sections of your resume based on what the employers want to see. For instance - I could have a series of buttons labelled “Tech”, “Forestry”, “Odd Jobs”, then on each job item in my resume I could have class = “Tech” or class = “Tech OddJobs” (notice OddJobs is one word now). Then the javascript handler for each button would toggle the visibility of each job item based on the class name. You can research how to make a collapsible as well.
- You can use FontAwesome to add icons for social media websites BUT your social media account must be appropriate to show to potential employers. For instance - I don’t mind employers seeing my Twitter, but I would never let an employer see my Facebook.
- You can add a portfolio page or section to show visual content. You may not be an artist or a photographer, but screenshots of your own applications can be a nice touch for people who are not technologically inclined enough to look at your github. People like Human Resource managers may really appreciate this touch.
